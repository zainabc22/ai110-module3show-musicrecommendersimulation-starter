# 🎵 Music Recommender Simulation

## Project Summary

In this project you will build and explain a small music recommender system.

Your goal is to:

- Represent songs and a user "taste profile" as data
- Design a scoring rule that turns that data into recommendations
- Evaluate what your system gets right and wrong
- Reflect on how this mirrors real world AI recommenders

This simulation builds a content-based music recommender that scores songs by comparing their audio attributes — genre, mood, energy, and acousticness — against a user's stored taste profile. Rather than learning from what other users listen to, it focuses entirely on the properties of the songs themselves and how closely they match what a single user has told the system they prefer.

## How The System Works

Real-world recommenders like Spotify and YouTube use two main strategies. Collaborative filtering finds users with similar listening histories and recommends what those users loved. Content-based filtering ignores other users entirely and instead analyzes the properties of the songs themselves — things like energy, tempo, and mood — to find tracks that resemble what you already enjoy. This simulation uses the content-based approach. Rather than requiring a large pool of user behavior data, it works by scoring each song in the catalog against a single user's stated preferences and returning the closest matches. The system prioritizes genre and mood as the strongest identity signals, uses energy as a continuous proximity measure, and factors in acoustic preference as a stated listener trait. It deliberately keeps the scoring transparent and explainable — every recommendation comes with a plain-language reason — because in a simple simulation, interpretability matters more than the complexity of the model.

### `Song` Features

Each song in the catalog is described by the following attributes:

| Feature | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | Integer | Unique identifier |
| `title` | String | Song title |
| `artist` | String | Artist name |
| `genre` | String | Broad genre label (e.g. lofi, rock, jazz) |
| `mood` | String | Emotional tone (e.g. chill, intense, happy, focused) |
| `energy` | Float 0–1 | Overall intensity and activity level |
| `tempo_bpm` | Float | Beats per minute |
| `valence` | Float 0–1 | Musical positivity (0 = dark, 1 = uplifting) |
| `danceability` | Float 0–1 | How suitable the track is for dancing |
| `acousticness` | Float 0–1 | How acoustic vs. electronic the track sounds |

The four features actively used in scoring are `genre`, `mood`, `energy`, and `acousticness`. The remaining features (`tempo_bpm`, `valence`, `danceability`) are stored on the object and available for future experiments.

### `UserProfile` Fields

The user's taste profile stores four pieces of preference data that map directly to the scored song features:

| Field | Type | Maps To |
|---|---|---|
| `favorite_genre` | String | `song.genre` — exact match check |
| `favorite_mood` | String | `song.mood` — exact match check |
| `target_energy` | Float 0–1 | `song.energy` — proximity score |
| `likes_acoustic` | Boolean | `song.acousticness` — threshold check at 0.5 |

### Scoring Logic (Algorithm Recipe)

Each song is scored by calling `score_song(user_prefs, song)`, which applies three weighted rules and returns a `(score, reasons)` tuple. Scores are unbounded — a perfect match earns **4.0 points**.

```
genre match        → +2.0  if song.genre == user.favorite_genre  (case-insensitive)
mood match         → +1.0  if song.mood  == user.favorite_mood   (case-insensitive)
energy similarity  → +0.0 to +1.0  calculated as:
                       1.0 - |song.energy - user.target_energy|
                       (1.0 = perfect match, 0.0 = opposite ends of the scale)
```

**Example** — user profile: `lofi / chill / energy=0.4`

| Song | Genre | Mood | Energy | Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Midnight Coding | lofi ✓ | chill ✓ | 0.42 | 2.0 + 1.0 + 0.98 = **3.98** |
| Library Rain | lofi ✓ | chill ✓ | 0.35 | 2.0 + 1.0 + 0.95 = **3.95** |
| Sunrise City | pop | happy | 0.82 | 0 + 0 + 0.58 = **0.58** |

Songs are ranked by total score and the top `k` are returned. Every rule that contributes points appends a plain-language reason string, so every recommendation can be explained to the user.

### Expected Biases

- **Genre dominates.** A genre match (+2.0) is worth twice a mood match (+1.0) and more than a perfect energy score (+1.0). A song that matches genre but feels nothing like the user's mood will still rank above a song that nails mood and energy but belongs to the wrong genre. Great cross-genre discoveries will be systematically buried.
- **Mood is binary.** There is no partial credit for "close" moods — a `chill` user gets 0 points from a `relaxed` or `peaceful` song even though they are emotionally adjacent. This makes the system brittle to mood label variety.
- **Energy similarity can mask bad fits.** A song with matching energy but completely wrong genre and mood still earns up to 1.0 point, which may push it into the top-K ahead of a thematically appropriate but slightly off-energy track.
- **Three features ignore six others.** `tempo_bpm`, `valence`, `danceability`, and `acousticness` are stored on every song but unused in scoring. Two songs that score identically may feel very different to a listener because of these ignored dimensions.

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate      # Mac or Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

### Running Tests

Run the starter tests with:

```bash
pytest
```

You can add more tests in `tests/test_recommender.py`.

## Experiments You Tried

Use this section to document the experiments you ran. For example:

- What happened when you changed the weight on genre from 2.0 to 0.5
- What happened when you added tempo or valence to the score
- How did your system behave for different types of users

---

## Limitations and Risks

Summarize some limitations of your recommender.

Examples:

- It only works on a tiny catalog
- It does not understand lyrics or language
- It might over favor one genre or mood

You will go deeper on this in your model card.

---

## Reflection

Read and complete `model_card.md`:

[**Model Card**](model_card.md)

Write 1 to 2 paragraphs here about what you learned:

- about how recommenders turn data into predictions
- about where bias or unfairness could show up in systems like this

## 7. `model_card_template.md`

Combines reflection and model card framing from the Module 3 guidance. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

```markdown
# 🎧 Model Card - Music Recommender Simulation

## 1. Model Name

Give your recommender a name, for example:

> VibeFinder 1.0

---

## 2. Intended Use

- What is this system trying to do
- Who is it for

Example:

> This model suggests 3 to 5 songs from a small catalog based on a user's preferred genre, mood, and energy level. It is for classroom exploration only, not for real users.

---

## 3. How It Works (Short Explanation)

Describe your scoring logic in plain language.

- What features of each song does it consider
- What information about the user does it use
- How does it turn those into a number

Try to avoid code in this section, treat it like an explanation to a non programmer.

---

## 4. Data

Describe your dataset.

- How many songs are in `data/songs.csv`
- Did you add or remove any songs
- What kinds of genres or moods are represented
- Whose taste does this data mostly reflect

---

## 5. Strengths

Where does your recommender work well

You can think about:
- Situations where the top results "felt right"
- Particular user profiles it served well
- Simplicity or transparency benefits

---

## 6. Limitations and Bias

Where does your recommender struggle

Some prompts:
- Does it ignore some genres or moods
- Does it treat all users as if they have the same taste shape
- Is it biased toward high energy or one genre by default
- How could this be unfair if used in a real product

---

## 7. Evaluation

How did you check your system

Examples:
- You tried multiple user profiles and wrote down whether the results matched your expectations
- You compared your simulation to what a real app like Spotify or YouTube tends to recommend
- You wrote tests for your scoring logic

You do not need a numeric metric, but if you used one, explain what it measures.

---

## 8. Future Work

If you had more time, how would you improve this recommender

Examples:

- Add support for multiple users and "group vibe" recommendations
- Balance diversity of songs instead of always picking the closest match
- Use more features, like tempo ranges or lyric themes

---

## 9. Personal Reflection

A few sentences about what you learned:

- What surprised you about how your system behaved
- How did building this change how you think about real music recommenders
- Where do you think human judgment still matters, even if the model seems "smart"
